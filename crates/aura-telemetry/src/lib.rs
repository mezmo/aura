//! Aura product telemetry.
//!
//! Opt-out, anonymous-tier behavioural analytics. See `docs/telemetry.md`
//! for the user-facing contract (what is collected, what is not, kill
//! switches, self-hosted sink).
//!
//! The entire telemetry surface lives in this crate so it can be audited
//! in isolation:
//!
//! - [`disable`] — the kill-switch decision tree.
//! - [`properties`] — sealed enum of every property value ever sent,
//!   and the [`properties::IntoTelemetryProperty`] trait that gates which
//!   Rust types may appear on an event struct.
//! - [`Event`] / [`EventPayload`] — the typed-event abstraction. Use
//!   `#[derive(Event)]` (from `aura-telemetry-derive`) to define events;
//!   any field whose type does not implement
//!   `properties::IntoTelemetryProperty` fails to compile.
//! - [`install_id`] — anonymous install UUID persisted on disk; sets
//!   PostHog `distinct_id` and never appears in event property maps.

// Let `#[derive(Event)]` resolve `aura_telemetry::...` paths even when
// the macro is used inside this crate's own modules (e.g. `events.rs`).
